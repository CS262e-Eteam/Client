## Calvin Marketplace

The goal is to create a cross platform marketplace app for Calvin University students. There is
currently a Facebook group (Free & For Sale) that allows students to post items they are selling, but there are
some major flaws with it: there is no clear way of indicating if items are still available; there is no easy way to filter or search for items (because people post pictures of books); it can be difficult to tell the prices of items; it limits users
to those who have Facebook, and listings are ordered by post date so some items get lost. The initial focus of the app would be for textbooks as that is one of the most common items found on Free & For Sale and one of the most relevant items to college
students. But we hope to be able to expand it to include other items like clothing, technology,
etc. The app will allow a user to easily filter and search for items in the marketplace. Once
they find an item that interests them, the app will connect the two users to communicate
about purchasing the item via email.

We intend to build Calvin Marketplace using Flutter which will allow us to simultaneously develop
for Android and iOS; this will allow users using both operating systems to buy and sell items increasing the number of items offered. Users will also have the advantage of a more user friendly interface for adding items, viewing items that are being sold, and searching for specific items by a variety of categories.
